## Problem 1 
  [Robot Game](https://github.com/sydneymagee/Problem-Based-AI/tree/master/Problem1)  
  * Simple bot written in Python to play RobotGame

## Problem 2
  [Terrian Model](https://github.com/sydneymagee/Problem-Based-AI/tree/master/Problem2)
  * Data provided by United States Geographical Services.
  * Data description: topographic map files. Cropped and downsampled images.
  * Deep Learning model for elevation data compression.
  * Trained the model on a single cropped or downsampled image that takes a coordinate and produces an elevation value.
  * Used the minimum description length (MDL) principle to compare the compressed tile to the original tile.
  * Altered hyperparameters to find the lowest mean squared error and greatest improvement.
## Problem 3
  [Spotify Loudness Model](https://github.com/sydneymagee/Problem-Based-AI/tree/master/Problem3)
  * Data collected from the Echo Nest Audio Analysis tool provided by Spotify.
  * Data description: 129-vector containing the avgerage absolute frequency spectrum for a segment.
  * Deep Learning Model to get the average loudness.
  * Altered hyperparameters to find the lowest mean squared error and greatest improvement.

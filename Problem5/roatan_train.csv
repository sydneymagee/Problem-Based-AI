We were delighted to hear that Honduras was the best ranked from the 4 countries of the Mesoamerican reef, Honduras is ranked at 3.3 on a scale of 1-5 where 1 is ""poor"" and 5 is ""very good"" due to the high live coral cover and high herbivorous fish. The Bay Islands, Swan Islands and Cayos Cochinos were the only subregions to have a ""very good"" and Roatan and Cayos Cochinos scored higher for commercial biomass. Thanks to Honduras' ban on spear and trap fishing we have managed to protect our parrotfish. Our long standing MPA protection, gear restrictions and effective enforcement have contributed to the groupers recovering. Increasing protection for large fish will allow them to grow bigger and produce more off spring, while effective management of Marine Protected Areas generates increased fish biomass and high coral cover provides the structure to support more fish. By following the fisheries rules and regulations, reefs and fishermen will have more fish. It's good to know we are really making a difference, let's keep up the good work!"

We do patrols during day and also strategic at night some of them are by land others by sea. We try to change our strategies because believe or not poachers are very creative and always find new ways to do their activities. Our rangers normally as soon the capture live organisms the free them around the area that they got them now in this case in my position as Director and coordinator of patrols and seeing the different methods they used I asked the ranger to bring them to West End so I could inspect the animals, take pictures of them in and out the bag and write an adequate report, I decided to release them on Half Moon Bay to avoid more stress to them. Now I want to be clear that this is not a common approach we do believe in releasing them close to the area they where found and we spread them, the only other time we move them is when they are in the popular poaching sites then we find other site where we can insure their survival. I ask the community to not only report this cases to us but also make sure that if poaches come close to your beach let them know that you wont tolerate their activities. Only together we will make a difference. RMP main objective is preserving the Islands treasures and will work hard to achieve it. Thank You for understanding and great job to our ranger that found this bags and conch."

,,False,True,False,False,False,Information,Information,1.0,0.0,,"Dear Jon, Thank you for generating the opportunity to clarify your points in an objective manner.\n1. Performance requirements are limited to buoyancy control and proper aiming and shooting skills with the Hawaiian Slings. Additionally, we have a liability release form which also states that you are aware that the Hawaiian Sling is intended for lionfish and lionfish only, and that if you are caught with anything else, you\u2019ll be in trouble.\n2. The most immediate sites to be impacted are those located within the Sandy Bay \u2013 West End area and also on the Southside from West all the way East bordering Oakridge; this shoreline, all the way until 60 m below sea level. Other project regarding lionfish control is being started with Punta Gorda (North-East) community members. \nAlthough the above are represents RMP\u2019s immediate jurisdiction boundaries, the new regulations are being designed to fit within a general Management Plan for the whole Bay Islands National Marine Park (all three islands). Therefore, one of the main drivers of change regarding for the Lionfish Program is the need to standardize the program within the three islands.\n3. Unfortunately, lionfish data from independent lionfish hunters is hard to standardize and make plausible conclusions based on it. But, lionfish population data is indeed being collected by the RMP along with other institutional partners through a monitoring system called AGRRA (Atlantic and Rapid Reef Assesment). Through this periodic monitoring system we evaluate the reef\u2019s health based on distinct indicators classified into benthic cover, invert biota, commercial fish biomass, and herbivorous fish biomass. Lionfish population is accounted for here. In the West \u2013 North portion of Roatan we have 8 permanent monitoring sites. \nThe data above is being collected and important publications are already available online (http://www.healthyreefs.org/index.php/en/)\nAt the moment, we are developing parallel monitoring systems regarding poaching pressure in order to correlate patrolling efficiency & reef\u2019s health, in a way where we may actually quantify our management success or failure, and to promote adaptive management based on pertinent scientific data.\nWe have no scientific conclusions regarding lionfish impact yet, but on a subjective appreciation we do recognize that populations have been declaiming within popular dive sites where lionfish hunters are active. \n4. Data to be collected after the new rules are enforced will depend only in the willingness of the licensed hunters to provide it \u2013 we have the intention of developing and promoting an interactive webpage were you may login key data that will allow us to estimate catch rates vs. man/hour effort in specific sites. \n 5. No data has been really collected from current lionfish hunters.\n6. We do need to be flexible and that is the spirit of our \u201cadaptive management concept\u201d, we change in response of objective experience.\n7. Lionfish numbers are clearly not the focus of these new rules, the damage being done to the reef by inexperienced divers with poor buoyancy control are the issue being addressed = RMP\u2019s point of view.\nOnce again Jon, thank you for your time in generating this important questions. I hope you may help us set these new rules in place and of course, I\u2019ll let you know when the lionfish hunter\u2019s portal is available for you to enter your own catch data. Best, Andr\xe9s."
